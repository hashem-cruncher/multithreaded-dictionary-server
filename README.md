# Multithreaded Dictionary Server

A Python implementation of a multithreaded dictionary server using socket programming and a worker pool architecture.

## Features

- Client-server architecture with TCP socket communication
- Multithreaded server with worker pool design
- GUI client interface built with Tkinter
- Efficient dictionary word lookup
- Comprehensive error handling

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tkinter (included in standard Python distribution)

## Environment Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multithreaded-dictionary-server.git
cd multithreaded-dictionary-server
```

### 2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

#### On Windows:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

You should see `(venv)` appear at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.

### 3. Install Dependencies (Optional)

The project primarily uses Python's standard library. If you want to enhance the GUI, you can install Pillow:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Running the Application

### 1. Dictionary File

Ensure you have a dictionary file in the correct format. A sample file named `dictionary.txt` is included in the repository. Each entry should follow this format:

```
word: definition
```

Multiple definitions for the same word are supported.

### 2. Start the Server

From the project root directory, run:

```bash
# Format: python server/DictionaryServer.py <port> <dictionary-file>
python server/DictionaryServer.py 8888 dictionary.txt
```

Parameters:
- `<port>`: The port number where the server will listen for incoming connections (e.g., 8888)
- `<dictionary-file>`: Path to the dictionary file (e.g., dictionary.txt)

The server will output:
```
INFO - DictionaryServer - Dictionary Server started on port 8888
INFO - DictionaryServer - Worker pool size: 5
```

### 3. Start the Client

Open a new terminal window, activate the virtual environment again, and run:

```bash
# Format: python client/DictionaryClient.py <server-address> <server-port>
python client/DictionaryClient.py localhost 8888
```

Parameters:
- `<server-address>`: The address of the server (e.g., localhost or an IP address)
- `<server-port>`: The port number where the server is listening (e.g., 8888)

### 4. Using the Client

1. Enter a word in the text field
2. Click the "Lookup" button or press Enter
3. The definition will appear in the result area
4. Status information is displayed at the bottom of the window

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If you see "Address already in use" when starting the server:

#### On Windows:
```bash
# Find the process using the port
netstat -ano | findstr 8888

# Kill the process (replace PID with the actual process ID)
taskkill /F /PID <PID>
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
# Find the process using the port
lsof -i :8888

# Kill the process (replace PID with the actual process ID)
kill -9 <PID>
```

### Tkinter Not Available

If you get an error about Tkinter:

#### On Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

#### On Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
```

#### On macOS with Homebrew:
```bash
brew install python-tk
```

#### On Windows:
Reinstall Python with the "tcl/tk and IDLE" option checked.

## Communication Protocol

The client and server communicate using a simple JSON-based protocol:

- Request format: `{"action": "lookup", "word": "example"}`
- Response format: `{"status": "success", "word": "example", "meanings": ["definition1", "definition2"]}`
